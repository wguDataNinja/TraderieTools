Requires [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) (available for Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, and others)

## Features

### UI Panel  
A draggable, resizable panel that persists its size, position, and open/closed state across sessions.

### Bookmarks  
Save custom-named listings or searches. Easily organize and revisit searches or individual items later.

### Ad Blocker  
Removes ads and sponsored content from Traderie using CSS and DOM cleanup. Toggleable in the Options tab.

### Rune Pricing (Diablo II only)  
Evaluates the fairness of Rune-for-Rune trades using recent trade data. All rune values are normalized to Ist runes, and trades are annotated with:
- Value difference (%)
- Offer/ask Ist totals
- Hoverable tooltips with detailed breakdowns

---

## Installation

1. Install [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) for your browser.
2. Visit the [GreasyFork script page](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/YOUR-SCRIPT-ID) and click **Install**.
3. Reload any Traderie page to begin using the script.

## Settings

All data (bookmarks, feature toggles, panel size/position) is saved to your browser via `localStorage`. No data is stored or transmitted externally.

---

## Rune Pricing Data

Rune prices are fetched from:

> [rune_prices.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wguDataNinja/TraderieTools/main/rune_prices.json)

This JSON is generated by analyzing recent completed trades, converting all rune values to an Ist-rune baseline. This enables a consistent way to compare the total value of offers and asks on listings.
